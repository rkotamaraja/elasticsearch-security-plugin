elasticsearch-security-plugin for Kiabana 3.0.0

<a href="mailto:ram.dhan@gmail.com">E-Mail ram.dhan@gmail.com</a><p>

Added a new security index to provide security around kibana 3.0.0 fifth milestone. Kibana uses a generic search query such as http://elasticsearchhost:9200/testindex1/_search. To provide security around queries like that, the pulgin is modfied to support addtional kibana configuration. Configuration is as follows. 

<pre><code>
PUT /securityconfiguration/actionpathfilter/kibana
{
             "rules": [
                {
                    "index" : "testindex1",
                    "types" : [ "testtype1", "testtype5", "testtype13", "testtype7"]
                },
                {
                    "index" : "testindex2",
                    "types" : [ "testtype19", "testtype21" ]
                },
                {
                    "index" : "testdata",
                    "types" : [ ""testtype1", "testtype2" ]
                }
	     ]
}

</code></pre>

This configuration allows users to specify which types in a given index are accessible by users. 


In 'TomcatHttpServerRestRequest' class, removed final on 'content' variable. This is done to enable the ES request modification on the fly so that kibana security can be applied.

In 'SecurityService' class added getKibanaTypes method to obtain the types that are accessible in a given index. 

In 'ActionPathFilter' class added 'massageKibanaRequest' method to add 'types' filters to Kibana requests. Kibana 3.0.0 uses one index at a time. So the methtod supports one index at a time. In this method, for all the types are evaluated against core plugins access permissions. If the permission evaluation for the type return true, then that type is added as a filter to narrow down the search query.

This plugin adds http/rest security functionality to Elasticsearch in kind of separate modules.
Instead of Netty a embedded Tomcat 7 is used to process http/rest requests. 

Currently for user based authentication and authorization Kerberos/SPNEGO and NTLM are supported through 3rd party library waffle (only on windows servers). 
For UNIX servers Kerberos/SPNEGO is supported through tomcat build in SPNEGO Valve (Works with any Kerberos implementation. For authorization either Active Directory and generic LDAP is supported).
PKI/SSL client certificate authentication is also supported (CLIENT-CERT method). SSL/TLS is also supported without client authentication.

You can use this plugin also without Kerberos/NTLM/PKI but then only host based authentication is available.

As of now two security modules are implemented:
* Actionpathfilter: Restrict actions against Elasticsearch on a coarse-grained level like who is allowed to to READ, WRITE or even ADMIN rest api calls
* Document level security (dls): Restrict actions on document level like who is allowed to query for which fields within a document

<h3>Compatibility Matrix</h3> 
| Operating System | Kerberos | LDAP  |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  Windows  |  AD with waffle; MIT, Heimdal with tomcatspnego  |   AD, OpenLDAP, Domino, ...  |
|  Non-Windows  |  MIT, Heimdal with tomcatspnego  |   AD, OpenLDAP, Domino, ...  |


<h3>Installation</h3> 
(Until the first release is out you have to build this plugin yourself with maven or download from the github release page and install manually)

Prerequisites:
* Open JDK 6/7 or Oracle 7 JRE
* Elasticsearch 0.90.9 (Maybe older 0.90.x releases will work too), 0.90.10 and greater not yet working
* If Kerberos is used you need an KDC like  AD, MIT or Heimdal

Build yourself:
* Install maven
* execute ``mvn clean package -DskipTests=true`` 

Windows:
``plugin.bat --url http://... --install elasticsearch-security-plugin-0.0.1.Beta2``

UNIX:
``plugin --url http://... --install elasticsearch-security-plugin-0.0.2.Beta2``



<h3>Configuration</h3>

<h4>Configuration (elasticsearch.yml)</h4>
Enable the security plugin
* ``http.type: org.elasticsearch.plugins.security.http.tomcat.TomcatHttpServerTransportModule``
* ``script.disable_dynamic: true`` Dynamic scripts are unsafe and can potentially tamper this plugin
* ``http.port: 9200`` Define exactly one port, Port ranges are not permitted

Setup Kerberos
* ``security.kerberos.mode: waffle|spnegoad|none`` Kerberos implementation (spnegoad is tomcat-built in Kerberos/SPNEGO support)

If you use spnegoad then you must provide the following configuration parameters:
* ``security.authorization.ldap.ldapurls: ldap://myldaphost:389`` Ldap Server
* ``security.kerberos.login.conf.path: c:\path\to\login.conf`` JAAS login modules configuration
* ``security.kerberos.krb5.conf.path: /path/to/krb5.conf`` Kerberos configuration file
* ``security.authorization.ldap.connectionname: uid=admin,ou=system`` Low priv login to ldap server (Omit for anonymous authentication).
* ``security.authorization.ldap.connectionpassword: secret`` Password for low priv login to ldap server (Omit for anonymous authentication). No encryption here, this is plaintext!

If you use spnegoad and not Active Directory you may want configure your LDAP layout
(look here for details: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/realm-howto.html#JNDIRealm)
* ``security.authorization.ldap.userbase: ""`` (Default is Root DSE)
* ``security.authorization.ldap.usersearch: (sAMAccountName={0})`` Default is (sAMAccountName={0})
* ``security.authorization.ldap.rolebase: ""`` (Default is Root DSE)
* ``security.authorization.ldap.rolesearch: (member={0})`` Default is (member={0})
* ``security.authorization.ldap.rolename: cn`` (Default is cn)

Optionally enable SSL/TLS
* ``security.ssl.enabled: true`` Enable SSL
* ``security.ssl.keystorefile: /path/to/keystore`` Keystore for private and public server certificates
* ``security.ssl.keystorepass: changeit`` Password for the keystore
* ``security.ssl.keystoretype: JKS`` Keystoretype (either JKS or PKCS12)

If SSL is enabled you can use PKI/Client certificates for authentication
* ``security.ssl.clientauth.enabled: true`` Enable PKI/Client certificates for authentication
* ``security.ssl.clientauth.truststorefile: /path/to/truststore`` Keystore (truststore) for public client certificates which the server should trust
* ``security.ssl.clientauth.truststorepass: changeit`` Password for the truststore
* ``security.ssl.clientauth.truststoretype: JKS`` (either JKS or PKCS12)
* ``security.ssl.userattribute: CN`` Name of the attribute from the client certificate user name which denotes the username for further authentication/authorization

Optionally enable XFF 
* ``security.http.xforwardedfor.header: X-Forwarded-For`` Enable XFF
* ``security.http.xforwardedfor.trustedproxies: <List of proxy ip's>`` Example: "192.168.1.1,31.122.45.1,193.54.55.21"
* ``security.http.xforwardedfor.enforce: true`` Enforce XFF header, default: false

Enable at least one of the two security modules 
* ``security.module.actionpathfilter.enabled: true``
* ``security.module.dls.enabled: true``

Enable strict mode if really needed (disabled by default, enable only if you know what you are doing)
* ``security.strict: true`` Strict mode currently deny facet and suggester responses and treat some command like _mapping or _analyze as sensitive write requests 


<h4>Configuration (security rules)</h4>
The security rules for each module are stored in an special index ``securityconfiguration``.
For security reasons you can access this index only from localhost (127.0.0.1).

<b>Example: Configure 'Restrict actions against elasticsearch on IP-Address only basis (actionpathfilter)' module. This work's without Kerberos/NTLM but maybe require XFF to be configured properly.</b>
<pre><code>$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/securityconfiguration/actionpathfilter/actionpathfilter' -d '
{
			 "rules": [
			 	{
				 	"permission" : "ALL"
			 	},
			 	
			 	{
				 	"hosts" : [ "google-public-dns-a.google.com" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "*"],
				 	"types" : [ "twitter","facebook" ],
				 	"permission" : "NONE"
			 	},
			 	
			 	{
				 	"hosts" : [ "8.8.8.8" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "testindex1","testindex2" ],
				 	"types" : [ "*" ],
				 	"permission" : "READWRITE"
			 	},
			 	
			 	{
				 	"hosts" : [ "81.*.8.*","2.44.12.14","*google.de","192.168.*.*" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "testindex1" ],
				 	"types" : [ "quotes" ],
				 	"permission" : "READONLY"
			 	}
			 ]		 		 
}'</code></pre>

<b>Example: Configure 'Restrict actions against elasticsearch on user/role and ip/hostname basis (actionpathfilter)' module. This needs Kerberos/NTLM.</b>
<pre><code>$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/securityconfiguration/actionpathfilter/actionpathfilter' -d '
{
			 "rules": [
			 	{
			 		
				 	"users" : [ "*" ],
				 	"roles" : [ "*" ],
				 	"hosts" : [ "*" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "*" ],
				 	"types" : [ "*" ],
				 	"permission" : "ALL"
			 	},
			 	
			 	{
			 		"users" : [ "spock","kirk" ],
				 	"roles" : [ "admin" ],
				 	"hosts" : [ "*" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "*"],
				 	"types" : [ "twitter","facebook" ],
				 	"permission" : "NONE"
			 	},
			 	
			 	{
			 	
			 		"users" : [ "bowna" ],
				 	"roles" : [ "*" ],
				 	"hosts" : [ "*" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "testindex1","testindex2" ],
				 	"types" : [ "*" ],
				 	"permission" : "READWRITE"
			 	},
			 	
			 	{
			 		"users" : [ "smithf","salyh" ],
				 	"roles" : [ "users","guests" ],
				 	"hosts" : [ "81.*.8.*","2.44.12.14","*google.de","192.168.*.*" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "testindex1" ],
				 	"types" : [ "quotes" ],
				 	"permission" : "READONLY"
			 	}
			 ]		 		 
}'</code></pre>


Permissions:
* ALL: No restrictions
* READWRITE: No admin actions but read write operations allowed (for example _settings, _status, _cluster)
* READONLY: No admin and no write actions allowed (but read actions) (for example _update, _bulk, _mapping)
* NONE: No action allowed (also read actions will be denied) (even _search and _msearch are denied)

In a more formal way the configuration looks like:

* Format is JSON
* One top level array named "rules"
* The single wildchar character (\*) match any user, role, host, type or any index
* In hostnames or ip's you can use the wildcard character (\*) for specifying subnets
* The rules elemens look like:

<pre><code>


			 	{
			 		"users" : [ &lt;* or list of users/principals for which this rule apply&gt; ],
			 		"roles" : [ &lt;* or list of AD roles for which this rule apply&gt; ],
				 	"hosts" : [ &lt;* or list of hostnames/ip's for which this rule apply&gt; ],
				 	"types" :[ &lt;* or list of types for which this rule apply&gt; ],
				 	"indices" :[ &lt;* or list of indices for which this rule apply&gt; ],
				 	"permission" : "ALL"&#448;"READWRITE"&#448;"READONLY"&#448;"NONE";
			 	}
			 	
</code></pre>
 
* There must be exactly one default rule:

<pre><code>


			 	{
				 	
				 	"&lt;qualification name\>" : &lt;qualification string&gt;
			 	}
			 	
</code></pre>

* If more than one rule match then the first one (right down at the top of the security config) is used


<b>Example: Configure 'Limit fields which will be returned on IP-Address basis (document level security)' module</b>
This work a little bit different then the actionpathfilter. First you have to configure a default for all documents which do not contain document level security informations. 
<pre><code>$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/securityconfiguration/dlspermissions/default' -d '
{
			 "dlspermissions":
				{
					"*" : 
									{
										"read" :["dlstoken1","t_powerusers","t_office","t_admin"],
										"update" : ["t_office","t_admin"],
										"delete" : []
									}
					
													
				}				 
}'</code></pre>
The above means that every field ("*") in a document which has document level security associated can be read by those who have obtained one of the listed dls tokens (in this example: "dlstoken1","t_powerusers","t_office","t_admin"),
every field can be updated by those with the tokens "t_office","t_admin" and every field can be deleted by no one (empty token array).

Another example could be:
<pre><code>$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/securityconfiguration/dlspermissions/default' -d '
{
			 "dlspermissions":
				{
					"*" : 
									{
										"read" :["t_admin"],
										"update" : [],
										"delete" : []
									},
									
					"qoutes.account.*" : 
									{
										"read" :["t_office","t_admin"],
										"update" : ["t_office","t_admin"],
										"delete" : []
									},
									
					"customers.*" : 
									{
										"read" :["*"],
										"update" : ["*"],
										"delete" : ["*"]
									}
					
													
				}				 
}'</code></pre>
The above means that every field ("*") in a document which has document level security associated can be read by those who have obtained the "t_admin" token. Updates and deletes are not permitted.
All fields matching "qoutes.account.*" can be read and updated by those who have obtained the "t_office" or "t_admin" token.
All fields matching "customers.*" can be read, updated and deleted by any one.

If a document contains document level security information those will be applied instead of the default. An example for such a document could be:
<pre><code>$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/finacial/qoutes/Id-12345' -d '
{

			"company" : "Hewlett Packard",
			"street" : "Packard Bell Road 1",
			"zip" : "12345",
			
			
			"customers":{
							"Apple":{
										"street" : "infinite loop"
									},
									
							"Microsoft":{
										"street" : "One Microsoft Way"
									}
			
						}
			
			
			"qoutes": {
						"quoteid" : "QO-7776-U",
						"amount" : 300000,
						"account" : {
										"name" : "Demo Ltd.",
										"classification" : "A",
										"tickersymbol" : "AAOL"
									}
					}	



			 "dlspermissions":
				{
					"*" : 
									{
										"read" :["t_admin"],
										"update" : [],
										"delete" : []
									},
									
					"qoutes.account.*" : 
									{
										"read" :["t_office","t_admin"],
										"update" : ["t_office","t_admin"],
										"delete" : []
									},
									
					"customers.*" : 
									{
										"read" :["*"],
										"update" : ["*"],
										"delete" : ["*"]
									}
					
													
				}
				
				
				
							 
}'</code></pre>

How to obtain a dls (document level security) token? It works very similar to the actionpathfilter:
<pre><code>$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/securityconfiguration/dlspermissions/dlspermissions' -d '
{
			 "rules": [
			 	{
			 		
				 	"users" : [ "*" ],
				 	"roles" : [ "*" ],
				 	"hosts" : [ "*" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "*" ],
				 	"types" : [ "*" ],
				 	"dlstoken" : [ ]
			 	},
			 	
			 	{
			 		"users" : [ "spock","kirk" ],
				 	"roles" : [ "admin" ],
				 	"hosts" : [ "*" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "*"],
				 	"types" : [ "twitter","facebook" ],
				 	"dlstoken" : [ "t_office","t_admin" ]
			 	},
			 	
			 	{
			 	
			 		"users" : [ "bowna" ],
				 	"roles" : [ "*" ],
				 	"hosts" : [ "*" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "testindex1","testindex2" ],
				 	"types" : [ "*" ],
				 	"dlstoken" : [ "t_office","t_admin" ]
			 	},
			 	
			 	{
			 		"users" : [ "smithf","salyh" ],
				 	"roles" : [ "users","guests" ],
				 	"hosts" : [ "81.*.8.*","2.44.12.14","*google.de","192.168.*.*" ],
				 	"indices" : [ "testindex1" ],
				 	"types" : [ "quotes" ],
				 	"dlstoken" : [ "t_office","t_admin" ]
			 	}
			 ]		 		 
}'</code></pre>
